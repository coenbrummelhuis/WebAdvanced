# Documentation
## Introduction
This document contains the documentation for the assignment WebAdvanced. The assignment is to create an auction site. The site we have to make should contain a backend and frontend. The backend must be done with node.js and the frontend with Svelte. 

For the auction site, we could choose any item we wanted to auction. I chose to auction books, because I'm interested in books and I already had a bit from the backend from Web Basics. Because of this, I already had the attributes for the book in mind. I also had the filtering.

## Technical design
For this assignment I created a backend and frontend. The backend is made with node.js and the frontend with Svelte. The communication between the frontend and backend, is done by using REST API. The backend is an Express server. With the Fetch API, the frontend can send messages to the backend. 

The backend has a few endpoints. Most of these endpoints are tested in the tests folder. The tests are done by .http files.
